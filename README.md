# MY-T3-APP-WITH-MS-SQL

This repository demonstrates using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) with MS SQL and in a development container as well.

If you clone this repository go in to ./.devcontainer, and make a copy of .env-example and name it simply .env

Update the variables accordingly and remove the appropriate comments where the values are.

After you have updated the environment variables for your dev container select the option to Rebuild and Reopen in Dev Container.

If your computer is not setup for Dev Containers yet see [Dev Containers Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) on the VS Code home page.
